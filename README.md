Building
--------

How to build the source code?
- First you will need to install [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
  Make sure to add Python to PATH when downloading it!
- Then open a `cmd` or `powershell` in the project directory,  
  and install all depedencies by running this command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- If you don't want to build the application, at this point you can just run  

```bash
py myc.py
```

- Otherwise, if you want to build the application use

```bash
pyinstaller --add-data "assets/icon.ico;assets/" --add-data "ui/credits.ui;ui/" --add-data "ui/app.ui;ui/" --onefile --windowed --icon=assets/icon.ico --name=MYC myc.py
```

- Now you will find the builded `MYC.exe` in the `dist/` folder
